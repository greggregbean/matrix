# matrix
Hello, user!

Here is my realisation of class matrix. There are practically all basic matrix operations like transposition, multiplication, subtraction, two types of determinant for square matrix and others. Speaking about first type of counting determinant it is the way by recursive counting of determinants of appropriate minors, whi—Åh seems to be slower than the second type. So the second type is the way by making a matrix upper triangle by Gauss method and than just multiplicate diagonal elements. All data members and methods with comments you can find in header.

So if you want to see my matrix class in work, just clone the repo and than make Makefile and executables with CMake.
